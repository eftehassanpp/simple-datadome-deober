Its a very simple and beginner Node js project to deobfuscate tags.js/slider captcha/interstitial
current working version for tags <b>4.43.3-next</b>, for slider <b>v1.15.8</b>, for interstitial <b>v1.15.7</b>
it uses libraries like "vm","jsdom" and widely used js AST processing library "@babel"
</p>
<p><b>contributions are welcomed if you wanna improve it .</b></p>

- **Educational**: To help developers understand how DD obfuscation works and how to reverse it.
- **Security**: To improve security by identifying potential vulnerabilities hidden within obfuscated code.

```

```
yarn inter
```

### Tags

```
npm run tags
```

```
yarn tags

it will deobfuscate the obfuscated code to a a more readable code . it will be atleast readable to find the nessesary functions and signal names(eg. glvd, glrd, tzp)
it doesnt remove deadcodes or switch cases.
